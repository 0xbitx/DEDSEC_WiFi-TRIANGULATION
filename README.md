<h2 align="center"> WiFi-TRIANGULATION </h2>

### DESCRIPTION 
WiFi-TRIANGULATION is a Linux-based Wi-Fi mapping and geolocation tool designed for advanced network analysis. It scans all available Wi-Fi networks in your area, calculates the signal strength (RSSI) to determine the distance of the nearest three access points (APs), and then uses this data to estimate your location. By integrating with Wigle.net, the tool triangulates your position based on the locations of the three closest Wi-Fi networks around you. Ideal for security auditing and network diagnostics, WiFi-TRIANGULATION provides real-time, precise location insights.
